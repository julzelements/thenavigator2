Hi James and team! To start this one, just type:
### `npm install && npm start`

it should fire up on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Bugs/shortfalls:
* The styling on the form is really ugly.
* The form is not re-rendering correctly. It does save the user data to the parent App state, however, I have not got it to re-display the data in the field again. : (
* I haven't added any form validation, so the workflow of the sidebar is semi-complete.
* I haven't managed to get the CSS hover with the tooltip to fade in correctly.

I'm looking forward to coming in and discussing how I built it. I probably spent way too much time on it, but I had a lot of fun. 

Cheers,
Julz
